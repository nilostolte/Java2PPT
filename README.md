# Java2PPT

In this project, the Java vector information shown on the screen, such as a Graphics User interface, is
automatically converted to PowerPoint by using a program in an intermediate language, which is run by our 
[MicroVBA](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint) interpreter 
written in VBA to be used in PowerPoint in order to be able to import large vector graphics files. The information is
written in a file containing the MicroVBA instructions that are read within a macro in the PowerPoint file
where the vector information is created using our MicroVBA interpreter that executes the instructions. MicroVBA language
is a subset of VBA for PowerPoint. This language bypasses the weaknesses of the EMF format (the lack of
gradient being the most handicapping) and of VBA itself (limitations on the size of functions) in order to import
complete vector files from Java programs to PowerPoint.
The program in this repository transforms the Java information to MicroVBA and is a modification of FreeHEP library. It 
uses an independent graphics superclass that writes the MicroVBA instructions into a
file. The user triggers the conversion by clicking on a button on the right of the screen with the text "Transform to MicroVBA".

In this program [MenuInfographics6](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java-Vector-GUI/tree/main/MenuInfographics6) example was used.
Any class extending JPanel that displays vector graphics can be used here instead of 
[MenuInfographics6.java](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java-Vector-GUI/blob/main/MenuInfographics6/src/com/MenuInfographics6.java).

In this snapshot of the program one can clearly see MenuInfographics6 and additional buttons on the right. One triggers the 
file MicroVBA file generation and another exits the program:

These additional buttons are not included in the file generated since they are actually only used to control the actions of the
conversion program.

These buttons are entirely defined in the source file [`Window.java`](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java2PPT/blob/main/src/com/Window.java) in 
`MyPanel` class. One can observe that the texts of the buttons are vectorized and stored as paths in the source code as indicated (functions 
**exitmsg()** and **microvba()**). 
This code was generated by [this program](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java2PPT/blob/main/PostScript/Ubuntu%20kerning%20java.ps). The
line 8497, shown below, should be changed with the correct path of the output file. Currently it has the path **D:\\Programming\\PostScript\\Convertion to Java\\Fonts\\Ubuntu text.java**.

```PostScript
/outfile1 (D:\\Programming\\PostScript\\Convertion to Java\\Fonts\\Ubuntu text.java) (w) file def
```

To make this program work on Windows one should have GhostScript installed and a shortcut created to call GhostScript with the file 
[**Ubuntu kerning java.ps**](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java2PPT/blob/main/PostScript/Ubuntu%20kerning%20java.ps).
Instructions to create this shortcut are given 
[here](https://github.com/nilostolte/PostScript/tree/main/Examples/Convertion%20to%20Java#using-windows-shortcuts-to-call-ghostscript). File
[**Ubuntu kerning java.ps**](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java2PPT/blob/main/PostScript/Ubuntu%20kerning%20java.ps)
contains the fonts **Ubuntu** and **Ubuntu-Bold**, BreakIntoLines function with kerning features, as well as commands to transform the text into Java. 
Ubuntu-Bold was the font chosen to be used in the buttons. BreakIntoLines was not actually used to generate paragraphs but just because the kerning 
heuristic is used with it.

A PowerPoint presentation that mocks the converted interface can be found 
[here](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/Example/testfontsembedded.pptm).
