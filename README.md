# Java2PPT
In this project, the Java vector information shown on the screen, such as a Graphics User interface, is automatically converted to PowerPoint by using an intermediate language, MicroVBA. This program is a modification of FreeHEP library.  It uses an independent graphics superclass that writes the MicroVBA instructions into a file.
